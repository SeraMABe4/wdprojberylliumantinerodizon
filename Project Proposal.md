# Website Project Proposal - Leaving Crumbs
_By Sera Mari Antinero and Dana Joy Dizon_

## Description üìù
Our website will be based on the American children's show, Dora the Explorer. 
Its title is called "Leaving Crumbs" because the crumbs that we, the creators,
leave behind is information about food that the visitor can use to become more 
acquainted with the cuisines of the world. The home page will bring the visitor 
a crumb from our explorer's expedition around the world. Our home page consists 
of the different cuisines that we will tackle in the website, American, European, 
and Asian. We will explain the unique flavors of each cuisine, and then the 
visitor will be brought to our second page. 

The second page has recipes of 5 of the most popular dishes in each cuisine. 
Each recipe will be precise and easy to understand, so that the visitor may
use it as a sort of cookbook. Rest assured, serving sizes and measurements
will be given. For our last page, the visitor will be able to do it themselves!
A page wherein they'd be able to make their own recipe as a fun little game. In
this page, the user would become an explorer themselves, exploring the 
different flavors that make their own dish.

## Javascript Implementation üë©‚Äçüíª
1. `Homepage`: There won't be JS here as it is only text information about
    a summary of the Cuisine's biography. The homepage is kind of like a
    "get-to-know" webpage about the food.

2. `Recipes Page`: We will use JS here by having the page be divided into 
    three cuisines, under each cuisine will be 5 recipes from those 
    cuisines. These recipes will appear by a collapse function that will
    be beside the cuisine names. Beside the recipes are checkboxes, when 
    you've tried the recipe, you can click on the box beside it and an 
    animation will appear with a badge to tell you "Congrats! You've 
    finished another recipe." Beside the recipe names, are also collapse
    buttons so that the page won't be too crowded with text when you first
    open the webpage.
    
3. `Recipe Maker`: We will use JS here by making use of the input tags
    as forms to get the needed information from the user to create 
    their own recipe. Using JS, it will have a template of a recipe page
    in its database, with some elements being left blank, as this will
    be filled by the information from the user. Once they click submit
    for each needed information, the template slowly fills up. It will
    mostly be for event handling as when the user hovers over buttons, 
    it will change color and so on and so forth.
